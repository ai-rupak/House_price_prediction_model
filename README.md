# House Price Prediction Model 

## Introduction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Model project! This project is a machine learning-based application that predicts house prices based on various features and presents the results through a user-friendly web interface created with Streamlit.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** The core of this project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices. It's trained on a dataset with various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more.

- **Streamlit Web Application:** The model is integrated into a Streamlit web application, providing an intuitive and interactive way for users to input data and get predictions.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The Streamlit web application offers a clean and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git or by downloading the ZIP file.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Run the Application:** Execute the Streamlit application by running `streamlit run app.py`. This will launch a local web server.

4. **Input Data:** You can input various features related to the house, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The model will then provide a prediction of the house price.

5. **Customization:** You can customize the model and the web application as per your requirements. For instance, you can use different machine learning algorithms or enhance the user interface.

## Deployment

To make this project accessible to others, consider deploying it on a server. Services like Heroku, AWS, or Azure can be used for hosting your web application.

## Data

The dataset used for training the house price prediction model is provided in the `data` directory. You can replace it with your own dataset or expand the current one to improve model performance.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions and improvements from the community. If you have ideas for enhancing the model or the web application, please submit a pull request. Collaboration is encouraged!
